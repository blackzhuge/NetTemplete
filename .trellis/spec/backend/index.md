## How to Fill These Guidelines

For each guideline file:

1. Document your project's **actual conventions** (not ideals)
2. Include **code examples** from your codebase
3. List **forbidden patterns** and why
4. Add **common mistakes** your team has made

The goal is to help AI assistants and new team members understand how YOUR project works.

**Language**: All documentation should be written in **English**.
